      <h4>About Us</h4>
      <p>The Library Management System is a web application that our team of developers, project managers, and business analysts are collaborating on to create. Our goal is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform that allows library patrons to easily browse and borrow books. The project manager is responsible for overseeing the development process and ensuring that the project is on track, while the business analyst is focused on understanding user needs and ensuring that the application meets those needs. As developers, our role is to write the code that brings the application to life. We work closely with the project manager and business analyst to ensure that the application is functional, easy to use, and meets the needs of our users. Our team collaboration is key to the success of this project, and we work together to overcome any challenges that arise and ensure that the Library Management System is a top-quality product.</p>
